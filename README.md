# Sudoku-Game-And-Solver
A project I worked on as a part of my studies: 
A text-based console Sudoku game, written in ANSI C, integrated with a soduko solver programmed with the Gurobi liniar programming library.
Includes source and header files, a couple of sample boards, a makefile, the instructions and specifications we were given and an executable file (Unix)
